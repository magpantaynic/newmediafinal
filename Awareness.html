	<h1> Why I Support The American Cancer Society</h1>
	<p>Throughout my life, I was so fortunate to know some inspiring people who, unfortunately, lost their battle due to some type of cancer. This is my way to honor their memory</p>

	<p> Cancer is a treacherous disease that has taken the lives of many good people. </p>
	<p> Let's continue to help communities who are bringing awareness and trying to find a cure for cancer by making a donation towards research funds or taking part of the events happening nearby </p>
